# Sales Forecasting with Machine Learning

## Supermart Sales Forecasting
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast Expected Quantity and Total sales based on various factors such as Date, Day, Month, Time Phase etc. The main goal is to provide insights into sales patterns and Predict Future Expected sales. The model is trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, consisting of over 1,000 Transaction entries. The implemented machine learning model utlizes a Random Forest Regressor, achieves a low R-squared score of '0.2' (Due to less Data points). The repository includes Jupyter notebooks, code files.

## Key Features:
Preprocessing and cleaning,
Feature engineering and selection,
Model training and evaluation,
Sales forecasting and analysis,

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

(Also I have prepared the dataset according to me so you can modify accordingly)

.. Please feel free to modify the code and use your own or other datasets, using this code as a reference.
